(Future) Prophet => tuch rItwI'  (canon!)
(past) prophet => pa'logh rItwI' (not canon!)

Brunnen-G => bIr'un-j?
Kay => qay'?    (== be a problem -> fitting for Kay, he was an outsider)

Master: ...pa'logh rItwI'...
Kay: ...rItwI'... ?


Original text:
Master:  In search of answers, Kai went beyond the Brunnen-G shields, to a tiny planet of the Time 
Prophet.  
  
Time begins and then time ends, 
and then time begins once again  
It is happening now, it has happened before, 
it will surely happen again. 
Prophet, I have come to you, 
here on this uncertain moon,   
Do we Brunnen-G, have any hope, 
or are my people doomed.  
I looked into the cycles of time, 
not very clearly mind you  
I gaze into, future past, 
and I see the Brunnen-G doomed  
For Kai you'll be the last to die, 
and there is something else I see  
the Shadows Order will be destroyed, 
at the hands of the last Brunnen-G  
"Are you certain Time Prophet?"  
Time begins, and then time ends, 
and then time begins once again  
It is happening now, it has happened before, 
it will surely happen again
