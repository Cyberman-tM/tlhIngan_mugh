A heap of attempted translations of texts into klingon


No code, just text - I don't really know a better way to store them online so I can reach them everywhere.
Once in a while I get an idea to translate a song, and soon get stuck, but I don't want to discard it all, maybe later I get a new idea.
(Or realize how horrible the original attempt is. In any case, it'll be useful to keep it.)
