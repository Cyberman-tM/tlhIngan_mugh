(Future) Prophet => tuch rItwI'  (canon!)
(past) prophet => pa'logh rItwI' (not canon!)

Brunnen-G => bIr'un-jay?
Kay => qay'?    (== be a problem -> fitting for Kay, he was an outsider)

Master: ...pa'logh rItwI'...
Kay: ...rItwI'... ?

time == ?? qun? (History)


Original text:
Master:  In search of answers, Kai went beyond the Brunnen-G shields, to a tiny planet of the Time 
Prophet.  
  
Prophet: Time begins and then time ends, 
and then time begins once again.
It is happening now, it has happened before, 
it will surely happen again. 

Kay: Prophet, I have come to you, 
here on this uncertain moon,   
Do we Brunnen-G, have any hope, 
or are my people doomed.  
Prophet: I looked into the cycles of time, 
not very clearly mind you  
I gaze into, future past, 
and I see the Brunnen-G doomed  
For Kai you'll be the last to die, 
and there is something else I see  
the Shadows Order will be destroyed, 
at the hands of the last Brunnen-G  .

Kay: "Are you certain Time Prophet?"

Prophet: Time begins, and then time ends, 
and then time begins once again  .
It is happening now, it has happened before, 
it will surely happen again
